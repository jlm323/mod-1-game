# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a spooky theme.

## Description

This project is based on the classic game, Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The user chooses an option between rock, paper, or scissors and goes against the computer, which randomly picks an option. The game is five rounds and the player who has won the most rounds, wins the whole game. If the user has won more rounds than the computer, the user wins the game. If the computer has won more rounds than the user, the user loses the game.

## Built With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Future Implementation
- Make the game responsive for easier play on other devices
- Add Player vs Player instead of just Player vs Computer
